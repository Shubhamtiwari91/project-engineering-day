<main>

            The Vikram chip developed by Isro was first introduced in March and shows rapid advances in India’s chip-making capabilities, following the launch of the India Semiconductor Mission in 2021.

            Within just three and a half years, India transitioned from being a major consumer to emerging as a creator of advanced chips, driven by government-backed R&D, stable policies, and robust economic growth. Vikram’s fabrication and packaging took place at SCL’s 180nm CMOS facility in Mohali, Punjab.

                <h6>Where it will use ?</h6>
<main>
                The Vikram chip, developed by ISRO’s Semiconductor Laboratory, is India’s first indigenous 32-bit space-grade microprocessor designed specifically for aerospace and defense applications. It plays a critical role in launch vehicle avionics, satellite systems, and spacecraft data handling, offering robust performance in extreme environments with a temperature tolerance from –55°C to 125°C. Operating at up to 100 MHz with low power consumption, it supports a custom instruction set, floating-point operations, and dual MIL-STD-1553B interfaces for reliable communication. Already deployed in missions like PSLV-C60’s POEM-4 module, the Vikram chip marks a significant step toward technological self-reliance, reducing dependency on foreign semiconductors. Its versatility and rugged design also make it a strong candidate for future use in defense electronics, secure communication systems, and potentially even embedded control units in electric vehicles or industrial automation. With in-house compiler tools and support for Ada programming, it’s not just a processor—it’s a strategic asset in India’s growing space and semiconductor ecosystem.

        <h6>Why it is important for india ? </h6>
<main>
                The Vikram chip is a landmark achievement for India because it represents a decisive step toward technological self-reliance in one of the most critical and competitive sectors—semiconductors. Until now, India has relied heavily on imports from countries like Taiwan, the US, and South Korea for chips that power everything from satellites to smartphones. With Vikram, India now has a domestically designed and fabricated space-grade microprocessor, reducing strategic dependency and enhancing national security.

            Its development aligns with the goals of the Semicon India Mission, which aims to position India as a global hub for semiconductor manufacturing. By mastering chip design and fabrication, India can support its growing electronics, defense, automotive, and AI industries with locally sourced components, lowering costs and boosting innovation. The chip also strengthens India's role in the global supply chain, making it a more attractive destination for investment and collaboration in high-tech sectors.

        <h6>How it is helps in problem solving </h6>
<main>
                    The Vikram chip, developed by ISRO’s Semiconductor Laboratory and Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, addresses a crucial gap in India’s space and strategic technology ecosystem. It solves the problem of dependency on foreign processors by offering a fully indigenous, radiation-hardened, 32-bit microprocessor tailored for space applications. Unlike its predecessor VIKRAM1601, the Vikram chip supports advanced floating-point operations, custom instruction sets, and real-time control algorithms essential for launch vehicles like PSLV. It operates reliably across extreme temperatures and harsh radiation environments, making it ideal for space missions. Beyond space, its architecture is versatile enough to be adapted for defense systems, avionics, and secure embedded platforms. With low power consumption and support for industry-standard interfaces like MIL-STD-1553B, Vikram represents a leap toward India’s semiconductor self-reliance and technological sovereignty, aligning perfectly with the goals of Atmanirbhar Bharat.
